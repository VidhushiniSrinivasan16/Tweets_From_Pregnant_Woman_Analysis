# Tweets_From_Pregnant_Woman_Analysis
We analyze word usage patterns in posts on Twitter to learn about information and support seeking related to the common experience of food cravings in pregnancy. We apply information-theoretic measures of lexical diversity across tweets to understand information sharing about the body and its conditions (measured by use of embodiment verbs), and about emotions (measured by degree of positive or negative valence) conditioned on degree of self-disclosure (choice of pronoun). Descriptions of food cravings were consistent with face-to-face work and included frequent references to sweets and fruits and sometimes included face emojis signaling humor and self-deprecation. Tweet content varied with degree of self-disclosure such that messages formed around variants of the pronoun I included a wider variety of emotion-related words but a more limited variety of words referencing the body than did those without that pronoun. Patterns of reduced word redundancy suggest greater elaboration with respect to emotional affect in the presence of I pronouns while enhanced redundancy indicates shared endorsements and concerns pertaining to the body in the presence of I pronouns. Findings are discussed in the context of prior work on communication in online and face-to-face communities.
